I have used SQL to store login details.
## Dependancies
Many python libraries must be installed.
You can use pip or if your using an Anaconda Enivronment u can use "conda install" statements.
I prefer you use this command line 
```bash
python -m pip install "name of library"
```
**THE LIST OF LIBRARIES:**
```python
speedtest-cli
GPUtil
shutil
pyside2
psutil
datetime
platform
```
In SQL youll have to run the following commands to set-up the database.

**its quite simple:**
```bash
create database se;
use se;
create table users(uname varchar(20),pass varchar(20));
```

**Keep all the provided files in the same folder .**

## Running 
Recommended to use VS Code . Execute the file LOGIN_PAGE.py.
This pops up the login page. Keep all the assest file in the same folder.

***connect to database by clicking connect.***

You can setup a new user id and password. Click login to login and the page redirects to main page .

**IF YOU DONT WANT TO USE THE LOGIN PAGE YOU ACN DIRECTLY RUN THE MAIN_APP.py **
